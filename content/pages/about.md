title: The Manifesto
subtitle: "At Einst.AI, We're embracing the meta universe and consider ourselves a meta-learning enterprise that is model-agnostic, in the sense that we're pretty compatible with any model trained with stochastic gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning."
