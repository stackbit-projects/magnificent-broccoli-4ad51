      Einst.ai allows EinsteinDB to learn from both internal and external
      “environments” to achieve high performance. Our representational
      capabilities are not limited to the possible: we are able to conceive,
      describe, and sometimes even believe, impossibilities.

      we vary the number of training queries that can be used for the
      workload-driven baselines and compare the accuracy with zero-shot learning


      A hallmark skill of einst.ai is its ability to rapidly adapt to new
      circumstances and "achieve goals in a wide range of environments", where
      raw observations directly map to values or actions.

      Contextual decomposition to extract interactions from EinsteinDB


      zero-shot query optimizers in einst.ai could come up with plans that
      classical optimizers would not have considered while avoiding the burden
      to run thousands of queries to train the learned optimizer for every new
      database. Moreover, when thinking more broadly, zero-shot models seem to
      also be an attractive model for any system builder and can be also used at
      various levels of granularity to predict the performance of individual
      components (e.g., very fine-grained on the data structure and algorithm
      level) or very coarse-grained (at the system level).


      *   Communications between the two domains are possible solely via
      cross-domain channels, an extension to native Go channels that deep-copies
      values to prevent cross-domain pointer references.


      *   EinstAI dynamically increases the number of knobs used in a tuning
      session over time.
